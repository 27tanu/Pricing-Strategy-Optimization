# Pricing-Strategy-Optimization

Overview


This project focuses on optimizing the pricing strategy for an e-commerce platform by analyzing sales data, identifying price elasticity, and determining the optimal pricing to maximize revenue. The project demonstrates how effective data-driven pricing decisions can lead to an increase in profitability.

Objective


Develop a pricing optimization model to analyze price elasticity of demand.
Recommend price adjustments based on statistical analysis and machine learning models.
Increase revenue while maintaining competitive pricing.

Dataset Description

The dataset used contains detailed sales transaction data with the following columns:

Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
Date: The date of the transaction.
Product Category: Category of the product sold.
Product Name: Name of the product.
Units Sold: Number of units sold in the transaction.
Unit Price: Price per unit of the product.
Total Revenue: Total revenue generated for the transaction (Units Sold × Unit Price).
Region: Geographical region of the transaction.
Payment Method: Payment method used by the customer.


Steps Involved

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sales and Revenue Trends: Analyzed trends over time and across regions to understand seasonality and customer preferences.
Correlation Analysis: Evaluated relationships between Unit Price and Units Sold.
Revenue Contribution: Assessed how each product and category contributed to total revenue.

Key Visualizations:
Revenue trends over time.
Price vs. demand scatter plots.
Revenue by product categories and regions.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values, outliers, and invalid data.
Verified Total Revenue as a product of Units Sold and Unit Price.
Standardized numerical data for better model performance.

3. Price Elasticity Analysis
Used regression analysis to calculate the price elasticity of demand, measuring how changes in price impact sales volume.
Identified products with elastic demand (high sensitivity to price changes).

4. Regression Modeling
Built a linear regression model to predict Units Sold based on Unit Price.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

5. Pricing Optimization
Calculated revenue as 
Revenue
=Unit Price×Units Sold

Revenue=Unit Price×Units Sold.

Determined the optimal price point that maximized revenue for each product.

Suggested price adjustments for products underperforming at current prices.


Key Insights
Identified that demand for certain products is highly elastic, meaning a small price drop could significantly boost sales.
Found optimal price points that increased overall revenue by ~12%.
Recommended pricing adjustments for premium products in specific regions to target high-income customers.
